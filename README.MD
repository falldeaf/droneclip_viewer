## Introduction

The DJI Drone Clip Viewer is an interactive tool designed for drone enthusiasts to view and analyze their flight data in synchrony with their drone footage. It utilizes a Node.js backend to serve a dynamic user interface that presents a rich set of information and controls.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Displays latitude, longitude, and elevation data. Elevation is shown in two formats:
  - **REL**: A percentage representing the elevation relative to the lowest and highest points during the flight.
  - **CEL**: A percentage representing the elevation from 0 to 400ft, which is the legal flight ceiling for small drones in many jurisdictions.

- **Path Mapping**: Integrates Google Maps to show the drone's flight path with elevation markers at various points, which can be clicked to navigate to that specific point in the journey.

- **Video Playback**: A video player that shows the footage captured by the drone, synchronized with the data and map elements to provide a real-time playback experience.

- **Control Bar**: Includes playback controls (play, pause, stop), a scrubber to seek through the video, a download button for the current video, and a dropdown menu with a load button to select from a list of available clips. Next and previous buttons are provided for easy navigation between clips.

- **Local Directory Access**: A navigation bar allows users to input the directory of their clips; hitting the folder button will load the clips for viewing.

## Important Notes

- **Local Use Only**: This application is intended for local use and should not be deployed on a server.

- **Directory Access**: There is an express path setup that allows users to serve files from any directory through the front-end interface.
